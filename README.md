# Shakespeare-Text-Analysis

Shakespeare Text Generation Project
This project creates a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) based AI model that learns to write like Shakespeare! Here's what it does in plain terms:

How it Works
Reading Shakespeare: The program reads Shakespeare's complete works from a text file, learning every character and word the bard used.

Learning Process:

Breaks down Shakespeare's text into small chunks (120 characters each)
Learns patterns by trying to predict what comes next in the text
Uses a special type of neural network (GRU) that's good at understanding sequences of text
Text Generation:

After training, the model can generate new text in Shakespeare's style
It does this by predicting one character at a time, building up words and sentences

Key Features
Learns Shakespeare's unique writing style and vocabulary
Can generate new text that mimics Shakespeare's language
Processes text character by character, maintaining the nuanced style
Practical Use
You can use this model to:

Generate Shakespeare-like quotes
Create new sonnets in Shakespeare's style
Study how Shakespeare structured his writing
Note: Training this model requires significant computing power, so it's best run on a powerful computer or cloud service.
